This is ESP32forth v7.0.7.15 (Revision 564a8fc68b545ebeb3ab) 
ESP32forth is an indirect threaded Forth for the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.
It uses a small C "kernel" that boots via inline Forth code.
The use of C allows developers to leverage C/C++ ESP32 libraries with minimal effort.

To compile and flash with the Arduino tools, load ESP32forth.ino.
